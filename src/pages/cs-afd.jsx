									The website was built to provide a seamless experience for both new and returning patients. A key feature of the site is the patient intake form, which allows users to complete their paperwork online prior to their 
									appointment. This helps reduce wait times and improves office efficiency.

								<div className="subtitle cs-subtitle-desc">
									Additionally, I integrated an appointment scheduling system that allows patients to easily select and book appointments based on available time slots. These features were designed with user convenience in mind, 
									ensuring that the process from booking to check-in is quick and intuitive.
								</div>

								<div className="subtitle cs-subtitle-desc">
									The responsive design ensures the website looks and functions well across a variety of devices, from smartphones to desktop computers, providing 
									flexibility for patients to interact with the practice on their preferred device.
